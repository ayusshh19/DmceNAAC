            </div>
            <p>AICTE launched the Smart India Hackathon as a national project to give students a forum to address some of the urgent issues we encounter every day. The objective of the event is to enlighten the students with the challenges of Software and Hardware Edition. The objective of the Internal Hackathon which is a process for entering SIH, is to scrutinize the solutions provided by team members for different problem statements listed by multiple organizations and Ministries of India. This helps students to understand the problem with different perspectives and to come up with a proper solution. The goal of this Internal Hackathon is to prepare the student teams for national level Smart India Hackathon.
                In the earlier editions i.e from 2017 to 2022 students of Datta Meghe College of Engineering, have bagged prizes and grant form various ministries for their problem solutions.

            </div>
            <p>Continues monitoring and improvement is the key to success, here in DMCE we strive for understanding the challenges which are faced by mentors and teams for realising the problem statements.
                Some PS are out of scope due to unavailability of the data required to build the applications. In such cases, students do the field survey to collect the necessary data. Students need long hours and weak days to implement the solution and institute makes the necessary arrangements for the same. <br>
                Some problems require well equipped IOT and robotics labs which are the challenges students face while giving the prototype.

            <p>Every year students follow the culture of helping in various activities which gives them opportunity to connect to society. During this process students come together form various disciplines and get exposure to conduct the activity for social cause. To fulfil the purpose of NSS activities, students need to engage themselves with the local crowd and win approval after explaining the benefits of activities. Students have to face lot of challenges from the uneducated people stating the purpose of doing these activities. Permissions from local authorities for carrying out the activities is also the procedure to be followed. Students learn patience and gain practical experience facing challenges which teach them lifetime skills.
